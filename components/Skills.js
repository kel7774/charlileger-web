      <p>
        "Managing what?" you may be asking. Well, I can manage people, projects,
        and the development of processes. Hand me a large task, and I can
        recognize anyone's potential, facilitate their role, and evaluate
        performance while refining the details for efficiency and company needs.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my strengths include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change Management</li>
        <li>Systematic Innovation</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Process Improvement</li>
        <li>Business Trend Awareness</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
